## 2

Already October. I want to start writing bit more publicly in both this journal but also in general. I have some articles I want to write. Some products I want to finally ship.

Last decade of my life can be considered a series of failures after failures. This last month is no different.

Literally every single institution that does pre seed have responded with similar emails:

Above is for [1Focus](https://1focus.ai) & its application to both [YC](https://ycombinator.com) & [Speedrun](https://speedrun.a16z.com). None like the idea of building an app for collaborative context engineering but I still believe in it.

It's all a bit depressing of course especially considering there are many apps I see on X that do get funding that are genuinely less useful than what 1Focus will provide. But alas.

I am not in SF and no one cares about a product that is pre revenue especially in EU. I wasted enough time trying to apply to places in US to know that you have to be in US to get funding.

It's a rigged system. I have ideas how to try fix this with another startup but no time nor funding to push it through yet.

But yes, I actually had a little crash out but [decided to remove all of it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikiv/commit/8b1f63a50712fd3958d07854a96e26ce02b862b1) as complaining is just noise. Only results matter.

I also updated my [habits](/habits). They are what makes me happy and sane in all this noise and failures.

One of my goals for 2025 as it was my goal for 2024 really, is to earn just enough money for food and rent (not yet achieved but do hope). But also to provide a better life for my parents.

They helped raise me and turn me into a person I am today and I am grateful for that. I am 30 years old so it's a shame I still can't afford my own food or rent with no one ever wanting to hire me and none of my own ideas working out.

They still believe in me despite there being no evidence to show for it.

Anyway, back to work.

In retrospect I actually love the messiness and unpredictability of life. The fact that nothing comes easy.

The only real issue is really the comparisons or not hitting expectations. But those expectations I set on myself.

My [lovely dog Rachel](https://instagram.com/p/CsJNYrUND8x) died in 2023. I am still recovering from it as she was truly something special. I didn't share this before but when I left the house as I was going to [Solana's Breakpoint](https://solana.com/breakpoint), I hugged her but I did not expect that it was the last time I will ever see her.

She was already quite old so in some ways I knew it was going to happen any day but I didn't expect it to be this sudden. She was in a lot of pain as she lost her hearing and panicked so decision was made to put her down so she did not suffer more.

The sad part was that I was not there. The other sad part was that I know wish I gave her an even better life than she had although she lived a great life I think in many ways.

It's my first encounter with death that is so personal. Someone who I love so much and someone who loved me more than anyone, no longer being here.

All that is to say is that this event has been very impactful for me. I now look at it and I look at my parents. My parents are both 53 years old and it's not super old. But it's definitely not young.

My dad also smokes and the biggest thing I want to give them is to have no stress. No stress that their son is a failure. I want to give them the freedom to travel and enjoy life. My dad wanted to visit Cuba for a while now.

I often think. Every day even that time is running out. Every day could be the last day I see them and I should make the most of it. But also try hard to actually get out of the mess that my life is now with all the rejections and failures and everything going wrong.

We also have our 3 cats, all 3 I love dearly.

I don't really know why I decided to share this publicly. I don't want sympathy or anything like this. I just feel fear and this passage of time. And how fleeting this all is. First for those close to me then eventually for myself too.

I still don't fully get the purpose of this whole thing aside from us being a bootloader to some eventual AI superintelligence. But it's an interesting experience nevertheless. And I just really really hope needless suffering ends everywhere.

There must exist a universe where everything is optimized to avoid suffering of any kind in any of its forms. In many ways, with the things I work on, I hope to bring us closer to this future.

And I am thankful for the other humans working on the same things. Especially working directly on problems in biology.

Ok, back to work. I hope to cover the basic needs of food, rent and some spare coins for more fun things like coffee with pastry. And then try provide those I care about most with a better life. I can't always be this useless.

Oh yeah and how I said before how it's sad that other companies on the order of millions for ideas that frankly are not as good or useful to the world. It's not sad. It's just reality. Comparision is a thief of joy.

I'll add that as a [habit](/habits). Never compare myself to how someone else lives their life. Just get some ideas and integrate it slowly into my life. Can't do more than that.

I just want to be kind, loving, pragmatic and **focused** person.

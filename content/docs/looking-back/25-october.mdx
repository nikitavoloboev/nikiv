## 2

Already October. I want to start writing bit more publicly in both this journal but also in general. I have some articles I want to write. Some products I want to finally ship.

Last decade of my life can be considered a series of failures after failures. This last month is no different.

Literally every single institution that does pre seed have responded with similar emails:

Above is for [1Focus](https://1focus.ai) & its application to both [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com) & [Speedrun](https://speedrun.a16z.com). None like the idea of building an app for collaborative context engineering but I still believe in it.

It's all a bit depressing of course especially considering there are many apps I see on X that do get funding that are genuinely less useful than what 1Focus will provide. But alas.

I am not in SF and no one cares about a product that is pre revenue especially in EU. I wasted enough time trying to apply to places in US to know that you have to be in US to get funding.

It's a rigged system. I have ideas how to try fix this with another startup but no time nor funding to push it through yet.

But yes, I actually had a little crash out but [decided to remove all of it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikiv/commit/8b1f63a50712fd3958d07854a96e26ce02b862b1) as complaining is just noise. Only results matter.

I also updated my [habits](/habits). They are what makes me happy and sane in all this noise and failures.

One of my goals for 2025 as it was my goal for 2024 really, is to earn just enough money for food and rent (not yet achieved but do hope). But also to provide a better life for my parents.

They helped raise me and turn me into a person I am today and I am grateful for that. I am 30 years old so it's a shame I still can't afford my own food or rent with no one ever wanting to hire me and none of my own ideas working out.

They still believe in me though even though there is no evidence to show for it.

Anyway, back to work.

title: 2025 October

## 2

Already October. I want to start writing bit more publicly in both this journal but also in general. I have some articles I want to write. Some products I want to finally ship.

Last decade of my life can be considered a series of failures after failures. This last month is no different.

Literally every single institution that does pre seed have responded with similar emails:

Above is for [1Focus](https://1focus.ai) & its application to both [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com) & [Speedrun](https://speedrun.a16z.com). None like the idea of building an app for collaborative context engineering but I still believe in it.

I am thinking of maybe making a page of `Fails` or similar and just post all these failures there. Perhaps it will inspire someone to keep going in case 1Focus ever makes it.

But yeah, software is hard and it's sad that the team that can in theory help build it are all busy with their jobs and lives so the progress can't be efficient for one reason & one reason only, lack of funds.

I often look at X and see all these companies raising absurd valuations and it just makes me feel sad just how unfair it is. If you are not physically located in US, specifically SF, getting funding is impossible. Like actually impossible.

One of the apps I want to build will try solve this & I will write about it more soon. But it's nice to actually live through the absolute pain of starting a startup with no funds.

In any way, enough rambling. One of the good things that I recently started doing, is abusing [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) for code. It's actually great.

Also I updated my [habits](/habits) with new core habits I want to do. Partly inspired by [Durov's interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjPH9njnaVU).

I am reminded once again by the [great Louis CK bit on how sometimes you are so broke it just becomes funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_-1l_SlA7c). I have the same with failures. They happen so often that it just becomes funny.

There is no room for giving up though, so will power through. Slowly but surely, will earn first $. Then 2nd $. And so on, and on. No company should ever rely on any investor money to survive or get started. You either have it or you don't. It was my mistake of applying to places like YC in the first place.

And I am actually calm & stoic now because I remember early this year I had another series of big failures with literally 0 good news & I kind of broke down from the stress. Wrote in the journal too about it but then [decided to remove it](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikiv/commit/adec6fd05c23306a8e8f76398b42208816e4e932) & set a rule to not complain again publicly.

Above is hopefully the last time I complain about how difficult building startups is. I do think with enough time of bashing my head against the wall, something will come out of it. Will see.

One fail after another. Nice morning and back to work.

Business is ruthless, I think the only way to really earn money in it, is only work on verticals that are proven before trying new things. So I am trying my hand at that first.

Small steps, there is little risk I will die of due to not having enough money for food as eggs are cheap so I literally just need to show up, write the code and show it to potential customers. Every day.

0 noise. Ruthless focus on B2B. Build software, approach potential clients, ad infinitum. If my business will start making at least 50$ / month, I will be happy already.

Okay about the suriving bit with just enough money for eggs, I lied. It's actually tough. I am often hungry for food but I have to budget the little money I have left appropriately.

Fuck. Ok back to work. I will get food eventually. I am actually so unhappy with how things are going with all the projects I have. Nothing works. No one cares about any of it.

It's all just a big dissapointment. Let alone thinking about the fact that no one ever wanted or wants to hire me is a big dissapointment on its own too.

Computers are great but I can't use them well to earn any kind of value.

I should be happy with what I have though which is not a lot but I am still breathing so until that stops, no problems actually matter.

I do hope I can earn enough money to give my parent's a better life though. Always feel like a failure. I am 30 years old. Earning 0$, literally just a burden to all.

Anyway, fuck it, back to work.

Mission for 2025. Don't suicide, earn enough $ for food. Hopefully I get my first $ this year, not next.

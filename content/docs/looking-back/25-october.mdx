## 2

Already October. I want to start writing bit more publicly in both this journal but also in general. I have some articles I want to write. Some products I want to finally ship.

Last decade of my life can be considered a series of failures after failures. This last month is no different.

Literally every single institution that does pre seed have responded with similar emails:

Above is for [1Focus](https://1focus.ai) & its application to both [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com) & [Speedrun](https://speedrun.a16z.com). None like the idea of building an app for collaborative context engineering but I still believe in it.

Never been as depressed in my life as I am now. Actually technically I was super depressed during my uni days too with no belief for a better day, this reminds me of those days.

I [wrote a lot in this public journal](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikiv/blob/be71de2d0d3312287a80deb53bf06d2125ed4bae/content/docs/looking-back/25-october.mdx) but [decided to delete it all](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikiv/commit/8b1f63a50712fd3958d07854a96e26ce02b862b1) because even though I am depressed and have little hope for my future, I don't want to complain about it publicly.

This better be done in confines of my private journal. The short summary of what I did write was that I am in financial ruin in so that I can't even afford food or rent & no matter what I do, nothing actually works or brings any $.

I can't get a job as no one wants to hire me and the software that I do write, no one cares about it to buy. So I am in a pickle. One fail after another.

At least I updated my [habits](/habits), they make me happy and sane. I also love my family. The big issue is not even that I myself can't afford food or that nothing I do works.

It's that I want to provide my parents with better life as they did for me once. But I am too useless for that to happen despite me trying quite hard.

Anyway, back to work. Will see what will happen. It can always get worse from here too so I should appreciate what little I do have now.

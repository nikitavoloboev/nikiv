title: 2025 August

Nearly 3 month since last entry. Been busy building.

[1Focus](https://1focus.ai) is out (kind of). Still need to add payments & fix up some things but its kind of there. Roadmap is clear there too. Applied to YC in August, will see what will happen.

Best thing that has happened since last time I wrote was that I found a genuinely amazing team to build things with.

Designer, development all covered by great people. Let's hope it works out.

I also deeply fell in love with [Jazz](https://jazz.tools). 1Focus is fully built with Jazz (and [Reatom](https://v1000.reatom.dev)).
